Abstract:
In the field of domestic robotics, which can perform human scaled tasks, having a rich knowledge representation is a fundamental aspect
that offers exibility and scalability to the system. More importantly for the system is to have capabilities which use semantic information, such as which household objects are related between them with respect to a human scaled action. In this paper, we propose a general purpose ontology which recommends sequence of actions on how to perform human scaled tasks in a dynamic environment, answer semantically related questions about household objects, and use Semantic Web technologies to find semantically related entities from the web ontologies DBpedia, ConceptNet, and WordNet, with the ones existing in the local Knowledge Base. This ontology tackles to a point the need of logic rules that semantically connect objects. Allows for more complex questions to be addressed to the system. It potentially, oers to systems the ability of performing mere complex tasks. The ontology information and schema was inspired by the VirtualHome dataset. The framework was evaluated via crowd source evaluation.
